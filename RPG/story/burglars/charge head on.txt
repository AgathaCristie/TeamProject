	So much for a plan <player> thought to himself and sighed, as he grabbed the first large
rock he laied his eyes on. The first man was already in the house but the other two were still
outside. They didn't know <player> was there until one of the thugs felt chunks of his mate's
brain being splatterd on his face. The thug pulled a knife but before he could use it a powerful
blow to the head knocked him down. As <player> was getting ready to finish him, a sharp pain in
his back stopped him in his tracks. He looked down and saw something shiny sticking out of his
chest. At first he couldn't figure it out. The pain was in his back and the blade was sticking out
the front!? But then it dawned on him that the dagger's edge didn't just appear in front of him
but was rather passing trough him, trough his hearth to be precise. "Ha, so that's what it is..."
were his final thoughts before slipping in to the abyss.
	The surviving burglar finished off his half dead acomplace. By himself he didn't have the
courage to face <player>'s father who had woken up from the racus, so he dissappeared into the
night.
