	<player> fought valiantly but in the end two against one was too much for him.
The burglars stabbed him some more to make sure he was dead and in their rage went on 
to murder the rest of his family. They took everything of value, and left. It wasn't
for months after that their crimespree would be holted and they would meet their end
at the gallows. So much suffering, so much death that could have been prevented.

					THE END
