	He then boldly proceeded unlock the door, but before he could open it a huge figure
kicked the already unlocked door, right in his face. <player> found himself on his ass. 
Before ho could even try to stand up, he felt a slight pinch to the side of his neck and then
warm syrup like substance flowing down his neck. The poor soul couldn't even realise it was
his own blood spewing out in big hot waves. He felt warm and cosy and slowly succummed to the
sweet embrace of death.

	As it turns out the stepps <player> heard were those of three particulary
vicious criminals, who uninterrupted, proceeded to ransack the house and murder all
of it's inhabitants. Now you have a dagger sticking out of your throat.

			Good job dumbass, bloody well done...
