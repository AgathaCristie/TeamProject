past his prime, but the experience of battle and the wisdom of age are powerful allies. Also

quickly as possible while trying not to make a noise. It was by no means easy, as the wooden
stairs made every effort to give up <player>'s location by the maze of squeaky planks. As a young
boy he had frequently snuck out in the middle of the night and now these exercises in stealth
would come in handy.
