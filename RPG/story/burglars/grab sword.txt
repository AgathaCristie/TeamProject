	<player> knew the there was no time to waist, and what if his mother couldn't keep calm and screamed!?
They would stand no chance if the burglars knew they were awake. The decision was simple, he snuck by his parents
and slowly pulled the sword out of the scabbard, careful not to make a noise. Even though it was probbably just a
few seconds to player it seemed like an eternity. Finally it was over, he had his fathers trusty sword firmly in
his hand and was ready to unleah his wrath on the men that dared attack his home. Meanwhile the burglars had entered
the house and <player> could hear one set of footstepps going up the stairs. He stood behind the door waiting for the
right time to strike. The stepps stopped just outside the door. It was time, <player> kicked out the door slamming
it in the thief's face. Before he could even reach for his weapon <player> had already plunged his sword in his guths.
The surprised man watched as the blade tore up his intestens passing trought the stommach and finally stopping at his
ribs. He couldn't even scream it was so sureal. <player> saw the other two coming up to help their friend,so he got
ready to send them too too meet their maker.
