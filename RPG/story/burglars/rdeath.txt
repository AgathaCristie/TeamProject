	<player> fought valiantly, but in the end his old kitchen knife was no match for a sword.
His last thoughts were not of the pain but of his family, he had failed them. Now they were at the
mercy of his killer, would they stand a chance...
The thug wounded, with his accomplaces gone, retreated slowly in to the night the same way he came.
Just to continue to terrorise villages, but this is another day, today he would lick his wounds and
rest.

						THE END
