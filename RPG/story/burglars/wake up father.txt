	<player> quickly woke op his father being careful not to desturb his mother slumber,
for if she were to awake there was no telling what she might do. A brief explaniton consisting
only of "burglers!" was enogh. <player>'s father a veteran of many campaigns had quite a few
tricks up his sleeve. The son watched his father as he was pooring lamp oil in a the dried out
hollow pumpkins that decorated the room. A plug of wool from his wife's knitting bag and miniature
incindiary weapon was born. <player> grabbed the freshly made arsenal, barricaded the door and
slipped trough the window. He knew that it wasn't very reasonable to set your own house on fire
to prevent it from being robbed, however the garden was expendable. He stood in the middle right
in the middle of it and yelled:
	-Get out of my hose right now!
The burglars were shocked, and at first thought of fleeing. But the boy's voice kept them
from doing so. It didn't sound like there was anyone else outthere, and they sure as hell weren't
gonna run from a measly farmer let alone his son. They checked to make sure he was alone and
went out.
	-You have a death wish boy? said the biggest one, as they were walking towards the lone
figure holding a thick candle.
	<player> just sood there, waiting for them to get closer.
	-What is it, you lost your tongue?
Just a few more stepps: thought <player>... aaand there. <player> grinned at the three men, pilled
out one of the pumpkins lit the improvised fuse and smashed it on the leader's big face. The oil
caught fire. The thug started running in circles. Both <player> and the other two burglars were
just watching the horrific spectacle as the man, now entirely on fire unable to extinguish himself,
was trying to cover his face as it was melting away. The thugs came to their sences and charged
<player> took another pumpkin and got ready to fight.
